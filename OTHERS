Ultimate Plumber
https://github.com/akavel/up
Written in Go.
Nice fast feedback loop.
Initial input is external to tool.
Pipeline is written horizontally, directly in the tool itself.
No caching?
Fixed 40MB output limit.

Pipecut
http://pipecut.org/index.html
Seems very immature, also stale/inactive.
Custom DSL and terminology ("blades"), not actual unix utilities.
No caching?

Pipeline
https://github.com/codekitchen/pipeline
Good, but pipeline is written in the tool, horizontally.
Doesn't allow cutting into the pipeline for observability.
Written in C with ncurses and readline.
No caching.

ShellPiper
https://github.com/TheYarin/ShellPiper
Graphical tool using Electron.
Has caching (in RAM?).

Composure
https://github.com/erichs/composure
More geared towards incrementally writing a full shell script.
Doesn't provide immediate feedback.
